## Whats here :

We created a custom made pdf file which contains nutritional information on foods for adolescent kids. We then made a question-answering system , taking Meta's "llama2" model as the base.

## steps to run this yourself :
1. Activate a virtual environment (Suggested, but not necessary)
2. Run the follwing command in the terminal :
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Make sure you have ollama installed in your local system, and llama2 downloaded within it.
4. Execute the notebook step by step.
5. You can change the question according to what you want to ask.
